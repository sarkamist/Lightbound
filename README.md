## Title: Lightbound

## Themes:

 - Dark/Light
 - Running out of Space
 - Running out of Time
  
## Summary:

You'll have to illuminate the path of a little demon while that is making its way into a dark forest. It will collect gold bags until it reaches the final treasure. At the same time, your lightbeam decreases and you will have to look for potions that will allow you to recover brightness to your beam of light while trying to keep up the little demon alive.

Your lightbeam also attracts nearby moths that will try to absorb part of the brightness.

Will you manage to help the little devil reach his goal? Good luck!

## How it works:

- Start screen to explain the operation of the game. Clicking starts the game.
- Dark screen where there is a point of light that follows the mouse and is reduced as time goes by.
- In the lower center portion of the screen, the remaining health of the demon that you have to protect will be displayed.
- As long as the demon is not close to a beam of light, it will lose life progressively. All over the map there are potions that will help you recover brightness and increase your beam's radius.
- As enemies, there are some moths that will chase the light and they will reduce the brightness when they are near it. Moths are killed by clicking them a determinate number of times.
- Final Objective: For the little demon to reaches the final treasure without dying and without the light being totally consumed.
